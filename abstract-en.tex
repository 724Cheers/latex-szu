RSS, which is shorted for Really Simple Syndication, is a format based on XML(eXtensible Markup Language). RSS feeds enable publishers to syndicate data automatically. RSS feeds also benefit users who want to receive timely updates from favourite websites or to aggregate data from many sites. Subscribing to a website RSS removes the need for the user to manually check the website for new content. Because the client is based on web, it can be used on any platform without installing additional client. What's more, with Pocket and Evernote, users can save articles of interest.
